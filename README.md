## Why Validating Postal Codes is Important

Validating postal codes is crucial for ensuring accurate data in applications that rely on location-based services. Incorrect or improperly formatted postal codes can lead to errors in shipping, geolocation, and data analysis. By validating postal codes, you can improve the reliability and efficiency of your application.

## Package Completeness

This TypeScript package provides comprehensive postal code validation functionality. Unlike similar packages, it offers a more thorough validation process, minimizing false positives and ensuring accurate results.

## Remaining Development Goals

While the package is already robust, there are ongoing efforts to enhance its capabilities:

- **Fix False Positives**: Address any false positives in the existing regular expressions to improve accuracy.
- **Exhaustive Unit Tests**: Develop a comprehensive suite of unit tests to thoroughly validate the package's functionality and ensure its reliability.
- **Additional API Functionality**: Expand the package's API to provide more advanced features and options for users.
